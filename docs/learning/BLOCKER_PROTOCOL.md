# Blocker Protocol

If blocked for more than 45 minutes, do this in order.

1. Write the exact expected behavior in one sentence.
2. Write what is currently happening.
3. Create a minimal repro case.
4. List 2 hypotheses for the root cause.
5. Try 2 fixes and record results.
6. If still blocked, ask AI using focused context:
- current code snippet
- expected vs actual behavior
- errors/logs
- what you already tried

## Stop Conditions
- If you are changing many files without progress, stop and reduce scope.
- If a milestone task keeps expanding, move extras to "post-MVP" notes.
