# Milestone 5: Test and Deploy

## Goal
Make MVP reliable and live.

## Build
- Add unit tests for:
- validation rules
- CSV parsing normalization
- balancing algorithm behavior
- Run a manual smoke test of full flow.
- Deploy to Netlify.

## Acceptance Checklist
- Tests pass locally.
- Deployed app supports full MVP flow.
- Can run one pilot with real data without blocker bugs.

## Common Failure Modes
- Tests only cover happy path.
- Deploy succeeds but runtime config differs from local.

## Reflection Prompts
- Which tests gave the most confidence?
- What would you harden first after pilot feedback?
