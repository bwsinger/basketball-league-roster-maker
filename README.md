# Basketball League Roster Maker

A beginner-friendly web app project to build and use for creating balanced basketball league teams.

## Learning Mission

This repository is intentionally designed as a self-taught web development project.

Mission:
- Build a real app that is useful to a friend group.
- Learn core web dev concepts by implementing the app in manageable milestones.
- Prioritize completion and understanding over feature volume.

Success means:
- You can build, test, and deploy the MVP yourself.
- You can explain how your state model, validation, and balancing logic work.

## What To Build

Use the MVP scope as the source of truth:
- `docs/plans/MVP_PLAN.md`

Keep the full-featured long-term plan for later:
- `docs/plans/PROJECT_PLAN.md`

## AI Assistance.

In order to learn real coding fundamentals use AI as a tutor and reviewer, not as a full-project generator. However, if the top priority is a working app with all the features you want, then it should be easy enough to build this app by feeding Claude 4.6 or GPT 5.3-codex docs/plans/PROJECT_PLAN.md. Feel free to edit this plan file further (ideally with an AI) to better describe your requirements or preferred technologies.

Supporting guides:
- AI rules (context to give AI agents to help you learn): `docs/learning/AI_USAGE_POLICY.md`
- Blocker workflow: `docs/learning/BLOCKER_PROTOCOL.md`
- PR checklist template: `.github/pull_request_template.md`
- Git/GitHub beginner guide: `docs/learning/GIT_GITHUB_QUICKSTART.md`

## Recommended Workflow

1. Pick the current milestone only.
2. Build only in-scope milestone requirements.
3. Run the acceptance checklist for that milestone.
4. Open a PR using the template.
5. Write a short reflection on what you learned.
6. Move to the next milestone.
